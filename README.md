# Image-Processing-and-Quantitative-Analysis
Developed Python functions for phase-contrast image segmentation, producing binary masks to isolate single cells from complex backgrounds. Integrated adaptive thresholding and morphological operations to enhance segmentation accuracy and efficiency, tailored to process over 1000 images with variable illumination conditions.
